I am a Ph.D. candidate at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xue (Steve) Liu](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html).

My research interest lies in the domain of Reinforcement Learning, Meta-RL and Applied RL. Recently, I'm working on improving policy generalization and sample-efficiency.

Service:

I'm a reviewer for NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS, INFOCOM, GLOBECOM, IJCAI, AAAI

Link to your social media connections, too.
