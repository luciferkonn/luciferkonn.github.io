## Motivation 

1. One approach of few-shot learning is **metric-based**

>üí° The main idea is to use the transformer model that given a few-shot task episode generates an entire inference model by producing all model weights in a single pass.


## Contribution

1. **Small CNN Architectures:** this method is effective than training a universal task-independent embedding.

2. **Large CNN Architectures:** 

    > We develop a novel replay buffer consistent with the architecture and training protocol of ODT


## Methodology

1. This paper combines DT with SAC, which adopt a maximum-entropy idea to encourage the exploration in fine-tuning.
2. Minor changes:
    1. Change replay buffer from saving transitions to trajectories.
    2. Utilizing HER to improve the sample-efficiency in sparse rewards settings.
    3. Sampling strategy.
